(let , const)-both are new and fast  & (var)-slower and older version

undefined meaning: future me koi value aa sakti hai 
null : wo reserve hai kisi ke liye 

variables have the default value of undefined

 primitive and non-primitive

 primitive are values 
 and objects are non primitive

 what are premitive 
 it is a data which  are the most basic data types that represent single values and are not objects.
 These values are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

 what are nom premitive
 primitives are objects , functions , and arrays

 the object values are store in a heap memory thats why if we write 
 console.log before deleting it it will fetch the final value of object from the memory


 operator 
 spread operator 

agar p1 se p2 me copy kiys hai value then 

 shallow copying - isme ye hota hai ki keval p2 ki value change hogi 
 deep copying - par agar nested object bana ho p1 me or p2 me uski value copy ho rakhi hai to jo bhi change karenge hum nested object me wo p1 me change hoga
